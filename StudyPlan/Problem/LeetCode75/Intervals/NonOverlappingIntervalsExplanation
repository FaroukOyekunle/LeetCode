Steps:
    -   Sort the intervals by their end time (ascending).

-   Initialize:

    -   count = 0 (number of intervals to remove)

    -   prevEnd = int.MinValue (end time of last non-overlapping interval)

    -   Iterate through each interval:

    -   If start >= prevEnd, it's non-overlapping → update prevEnd

    -   Else, it's overlapping → increment count

Return count
