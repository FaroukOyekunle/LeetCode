Explanation:

-   Objective:
    -   Determine, for each kid, if giving them extraCandies would allow them to have at least as many candies as the kid with the maximum candies currently.

-   Step 1: Find the Maximum Candy Count

    -   Initialize maxCandy to 0.
    -   Loop through the candies array:
    -   For each candy, if it is greater than maxCandy, update maxCandy.
    -   After the loop, maxCandy holds the highest number of candies any kid currently has.

-   Step 2: Determine Which Kids Can Reach or Exceed the Maximum

    -   Create a list result to store boolean values for each kid.
    -   Loop through the candies array again:
    -   For each candy, check if candy + extraCandies >= maxCandy.
    -   Add the resulting boolean value (true or false) to the result list.
    -   This evaluates whether giving a kid all extraCandies would allow them to have at least as many candies as the current maximum.

-   Step 3: Return the Result

    -   Return the result list, which contains a boolean for each kid indicating whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving the extra candies.
