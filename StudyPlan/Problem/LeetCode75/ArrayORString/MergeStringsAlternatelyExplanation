Explanation:
String Length Calculation:
- I compute the lengths of word1 and word2 to determine the maximum number of iterations required.

Iteration:
- Iterate from index 0 to maxLength - 1, where maxLength is the maximum of word1.Length and word2.Length.

Conditional Appending:
- At each iteration, if the current index is within word1's length, we append word1[i] to the result.
- Similarly, if the current index is within word2's length, we also append word2[i] to the result.

StringBuilder Usage:
- Use StringBuilder for efficient concatenation of characters during the iteration.

Return:
- Convert the StringBuilder to a string and return the merged result.

Time & Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the maximum length of the two strings.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the StringBuilder that holds the merged string.
