Explanation

-   Main Idea:
    -   We use a binary search algorithm to efficiently narrow down the number that was picked.

-   Step-by-Step Approach:

    -   Initialize Pointers:

        -   left is set to 1, and right is set to n.

    -   Binary Search Loop:

        -   Calculate the middle point mid.

        -   Call the API guess(mid):

        -   If it returns 0, mid is the picked number.

        -   If it returns -1, the picked number is lower than mid, so adjust right.

        -   If it returns 1, the picked number is higher than mid, so adjust left.

    -   Termination:

    -   The loop continues until left exceeds right, at which point the correct number has been found.

-   Time Complexity: 𝑂(log𝑛) since the search space is halved on each iteration.

-   Space Complexity: 𝑂(1), as only a few variables are used.
