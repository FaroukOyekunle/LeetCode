Explanation:

-   Sliding Window Technique:

    -   We maintain a window with two pointers, left and right.
    -   As we extend the window with right, we count the number of zeros in the current window.

-   Controlling Zero Count:

    -   We allow at most one zero in the window since we are allowed to delete one element.
    -   If the count of zeros exceeds one, we increment left until the window is valid again (i.e., contains at most one zero).

-   Window Length Calculation:

    -   The length of the window is (right - left + 1). Since one element must be deleted from this window, the effective length of consecutive 1's becomes (right - left + 1 - 1) = (right - left).
    -   We keep track of the maximum effective length in res.

-   Edge Case - All Ones:

    -   If the array has all 1's, we still have to delete one element, and the maximum subarray length of 1's becomes nums.Length - 1.
Complexity:

-   Time Complexity: O(n), as we traverse the array once.
-   Space Complexity: O(1), using only a few extra variables.
