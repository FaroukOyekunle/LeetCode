Explanation:

-   Vowel Lookup:

    -   A HashSet<char> is used to quickly check if a character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

-   Initial Window Setup:

    -   The first k characters of the string are processed to count the number of vowels, initializing both count and maxCount.

-   Sliding Window Technique:

-   For each subsequent character from index k to the end of the string:

-   Slide Out:

    -   Remove the effect of the character that is leaving the window (i.e., at position i - k). If it's a vowel, decrement the count.

-   Slide In:
    -   Add the effect of the new character entering the window (i.e., at position i). If it's a vowel, increment the count.

-   Update Maximum:
    -   The maximum vowel count (maxCount) is updated if the current window's count is higher.

-   Early Termination:
    -   If maxCount equals k, that's the maximum possible number of vowels in a window of length k, so the function returns immediately.

-   Result:

The function returns the highest number of vowels found in any contiguous substring of length k.
