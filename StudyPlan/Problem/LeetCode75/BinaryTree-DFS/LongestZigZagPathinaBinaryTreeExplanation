Explanation:

-   Initialize maxZigZag to track the longest zigzag path.

-   DFS Traversal
    -   Start DFS from the left and right children of the root.
    -   If moving left, the next move should be right, and vice versa.
    -   If the move continues in the same direction, reset the count to 1.
    -   If the move changes direction, increment the count.

-   Update maxZigZag at each step.

-   Base Case: Stop recursion when node == null.

Time Complexity:
-   DFS visits each node once → 𝑂(𝑁), where 𝑁 is the number of nodes.
-   Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝐻) for recursion stack (worst case: 𝑂(𝑁) for a skewed tree, 𝑂(log⁡𝑁) for balanced trees).
