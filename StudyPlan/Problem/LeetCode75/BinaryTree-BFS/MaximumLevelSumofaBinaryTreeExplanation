Explanation

-   Main Idea:

    -   We perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) (level-order traversal) to compute the sum of node values at each level.
    -   Track the level with the maximum sum.

-   Step-by-Step Approach:

-   Initialize a Queue:
    -   Start with the root node in the queue.
    -   Iterate Level by Level:
    -   For each level, determine the number of nodes (levelSize) and compute the total sum of that level.

-   Update Maximum Sum:
    -   If the current level’s sum exceeds the maximum sum recorded so far, update the maximum sum and record the current level.

-   Enqueue Children:
    -   Add the left and right children of each node to the queue for processing the next level.

-   Return Result:
    -   After processing all levels, return the level number with the highest sum.

-   Time Complexity:𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes, since we visit each node once.

-   Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) in the worst-case scenario, when the tree has a level with a large number of nodes.
