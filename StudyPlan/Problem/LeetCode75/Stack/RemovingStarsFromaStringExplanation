Explanation:

-   Stack Simulation Using StringBuilder:
    -   We iterate over the input string s and use a StringBuilder to simulate a stack.

-   Processing Each Character:
    -   If the character is not a star (*):
    -   Append the character to the StringBuilder.
    -   If the character is a star (*):
    -   Remove the most recent character from the StringBuilder (i.e., pop from the stack).

-   Result:
    -   After processing all characters, the StringBuilder contains the string after all operations, which we return.
