Explanation

-   Main Idea:

    -   The goal is to count the number of provinces (connected components) in the graph represented by the isConnected matrix.

    -   Two cities belong to the same province if they are directly or indirectly connected.

-   Step-by-Step Approach:

-   Initialization:

    -   Create a boolean array visited to keep track of which cities have been explored.

    -   Initialize a counter provinces to 0.

    -   Traverse the Cities:

    -   Loop through each city.

    -   If a city is not visited, it indicates the start of a new province.

    -   Increment provinces.

    -   Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from this city to mark all cities in this province as visited.

-   DFS Traversal:

    -   In the DFS function, mark the current city as visited.

    -   For every other city, if it is directly connected to the current city and not yet visited, recursively perform DFS on that city.

    -   Return the Count:

    -   After processing all cities, the provinces counter reflects the total number of connected components (provinces).


-   Complexity Analysis:

-   Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) since the algorithm processes each cell in the n x n matrix.

-   Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) for the visited array and recursion stack in the worst case.
