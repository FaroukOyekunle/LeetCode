Explanation:

-   Initial Conditions:
    -   The biker starts at altitude 0.

-   Processing Gains:
    -   We iterate through the gain array.
    -   For each element delta, add it to the current altitude.
    -   Update maxAltitude by comparing it with the current altitude.
-   Result:
    -   Return maxAltitude, which represents the highest altitude reached during the trip.
