Explanation:

-   Count Occurrences:
    -   We use a Dictionary<int, int> to count the frequency of each element in arr.

-   Check Uniqueness:
    -   We iterate over the frequency values and insert them into a HashSet<int>.
    -   If a frequency is already in the set, it means two values have the same occurrence count, and we return false.

-   Return:
    -   If all frequency counts are unique, we return true.
