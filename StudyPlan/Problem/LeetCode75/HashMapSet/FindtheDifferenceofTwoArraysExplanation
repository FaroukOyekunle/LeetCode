Explanation:

-   Unique Element Sets:
    -   Convert nums1 and nums2 into HashSet<int> objects (set1 and set2) to remove duplicates and allow fast lookups.

-   Finding Differences:

    -   For nums1:
        -   Iterate through set1 and add any number not present in set2 to diff1.
    -   For nums2:
        -   Iterate through set2 and add any number not present in set1 to diff2.

-   Return Format:
    -   The method returns a list containing two lists: diff1 (numbers unique to nums1) and diff2 (numbers unique to nums2).

Complexity:

-   Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
-   Space Complexity: O(n + m), due to the use of hash sets and result lists.
