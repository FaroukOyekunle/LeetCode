Explanation:

-   Finding the Middle:
    -   We use the slow and fast pointer technique. While fast advances two nodes at a time and slow advances one node at a time, 
        slow reaches the middle of the list. For an even-length list, slow will point to the start of the second half.

-   Reversing the Second Half:
    -   Starting from the slow pointer, we reverse the linked list using the standard iterative approach. After reversing, 
        prev will be the new head of the reversed second half.

-   Computing Twin Sums:
    -   With the first half (starting at head) and the reversed second half (starting at prev), we traverse both halves simultaneously. 
        The twin sum for each pair is the sum of the corresponding nodes. We update maxSum with the maximum twin sum encountered.

-   Returning the Result:
    -   Finally, the maximum twin sum is returned.
