Explanation:

- Edge Case Handling:

    -   If the linked list has only one node (head.next == null), then after deleting the middle node, there will be no nodes left, so we return null.

-   Two-Pointer Technique:

    -   We initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both starting at the head of the list.
    -   fast moves two steps at a time, while slow moves one step at a time.
    -   When fast reaches the end of the list (or fast.next is null), slow will be at the middle node.

-   Deleting the Middle Node:

    -   We keep a pointer prev to track the node immediately before slow.
    -   Once the middle node (slow) is found, we remove it by setting prev.next = slow.next.
Return:

    -   Finally, we return the head of the modified linked list.
