Detailed Explanation

-   DP Definition
    -   dp[i,j] = the minimum number of edit operations (insert, delete, replace) to transform the prefix word1[0..i-1] into word2[0..j-1].

-   Initialization

    -   dp[0,j] = j because transforming an empty string into a length‑j string requires j insertions.

    -   dp[i,0] = i because transforming a length‑i string into empty requires i deletions.

-   Recurrence

    -   If the current characters match (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]), no new operation is needed:

            dp[i,j] = dp[i-1, j-1]
    -   Otherwise, we consider the three operations:

    -   Insert word2[j-1] into word1[0..i-1], matching that character →
    -   dp[i, j-1] + 1

    Delete word1[i-1] →
    dp[i-1, j] + 1

    -   Replace word1[i-1] with word2[j-1] →
    dp[i-1, j-1] + 1

-   Take the minimum of these three.

-   Answer
dp[m, n] gives the edit distance from word1 to word2.
