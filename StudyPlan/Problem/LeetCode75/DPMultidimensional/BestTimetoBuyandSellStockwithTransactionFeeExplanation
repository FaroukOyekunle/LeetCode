Explanation
-   We maintain two variables per day:

    -   cash: Maximum profit so far if not holding a share.

    -   hold: Maximum profit so far if holding a share.

-   Initialization

    -   cash = 0 (no profit, no share)

    -   hold = -prices[0] (we bought on day 0)

-   Transition for day i:

    -   Sell (move from hold→cash):
    -   cash = max(prevCash, prevHold + prices[i] - fee)

    -   Buy (move from cash→hold):
    -   hold = max(prevHold, prevCash - prices[i])

    -   The transaction fee is subtracted only once on selling.

Answer
At the end of day n-1, the maximum profit with no share in hand is cash.
