Explanation:
-   Two-Pointer Approach:

    -   insertPos: Points to the next position where a non-zero element should be placed.
    -   Iteration: Traverse the array with index i.

-   rocessing Non-Zero Elements:

    -   If nums[i] is non-zero, we place it at nums[insertPos].
    -   If i is not equal to insertPos, we set nums[i] to zero after moving the non-zero element.
    -   Then we increment insertPos to prepare for the next non-zero element.

-   Outcome:

    -   All non-zero elements are moved to the beginning of the array in their original order.
    -   While zeros are moved to the end of the array.

-   Time & Space Complexity:

    -   Time Complexity: O(n) — the array is traversed once.
    -   Space Complexity: O(1) — modifications are made in-place with a constant number of extra variables.
