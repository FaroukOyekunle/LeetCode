Explanation:
Preprocessing t:

-   Purpose:
    -   To handle the follow-up scenario where there are many queries (incoming s strings), we preprocess t once.

-   Method:
    -   We create a dictionary that maps each character in t to a list of its indices in t.
    -   This allows fast lookups of where each character occurs in t.

-   Processing s:

    -   Two-step Process for Each Character in s:
        -   For each character in s, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If not, s cannot be a subsequence.
        -   Then we use binary search on the list of indices for that character to find the smallest index that is at least the current required position (currPos).
        -  We update currPos to one more than the found index to ensure the order of characters is maintained.

-   Binary Search Helper:

    -   Functionality:
        -   Given a sorted list of indices and a target value, it returns the smallest index that is greater than or equal to the target.
        -   If no such index exists, it returns -1, indicating that the current character in s cannot be found in t after currPos.

-   Time & Space Complexity:

-   Preprocessing t:
    -   Time: O(t.Length)
    -   Space: O(t.Length)

-   Querying s:
    -   For each character in s, a binary search is performed in O(log(t.Length)).
    -   Overall, each query runs in O(s.Length * log(t.Length)).

-   Follow-up Benefit:
    -   Since t is preprocessed once, each subsequent query s can be checked efficiently.
