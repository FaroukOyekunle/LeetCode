Explanation:
-   Iterate through the flowerbed array.
-   If the current plot is empty (0), then i check if the left and right neighbors are also empty.
-   If both are empty (or out of bounds), then we plant a flower (1) and increment the count.
-   If at any point count reaches n, then we return true.
-   If the loop completes without reaching n, we return false.


Time Complexity: O(N), where ùëÅ is the length of the flowerbed.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we modify the input array in place.
