Explanation

-   States

    -   dp[i]: Ways to fully tile a 2 x i board.

    -   dp2[i]: Ways to tile a 2 x i board with exactly one cell missing in the last column (either top or bottom).

-   Transitions

    -   dp2[i]

        -   You can get a single-missing-column configuration by adding a horizontal domino to a full 2 x (i-2) board, 
            or by extending a previous single-missing with a vertical domino:
            𝑑𝑝2[𝑖] = 𝑑𝑝[𝑖 − 2] + 𝑑𝑝2[𝑖 − 1]
    
    -   dp[i]

        -   Fully tile by:

            -   Adding a vertical domino to a full 2 x (i-1) board.

            -   Adding two horizontal dominoes to a full 2 x (i-2) board.

            -   Filling in a missing cell from dp2[i-1] with a tromino (2 orientations):
            𝑑𝑝[𝑖] = 𝑑𝑝[𝑖 − 1] + 𝑑𝑝[𝑖 − 2] + 2 × 𝑑𝑝2[𝑖 − 1]

-   Base Cases

    -   dp[0] = 1, empty board.

    -   dp[1] = 1, only one vertical domino.

    -   dp2[0] = dp2[1] = 0, cannot have a missing cell on such small boards.
