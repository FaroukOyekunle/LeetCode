Explanation:
-   I basically use a HashSet to store vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) for quick lookup.
-   Then convert the string to a character array to perform in-place modifications.
-   Use two pointers (left and right):
    -   Move variable left forward until it finds a vowel.
    -   Move variable right backward until it finds a vowel.
    -   Then swap the vowels at left and right, then move both pointers inward.
-   We then finally return the modified string after processing.

Time & Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N), (each character is processed at most once).

Space Complexity: O(N), (char array for in-place modifications).
