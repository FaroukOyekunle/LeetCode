To solve this, we need to:

1.  Handle edge cases: where obj or classFunction are undefined, null, or not valid objects/functions.

2.  Support primitives like 5 or 'hello', which aren't technically instances (instanceof fails) but still inherit from wrapper constructors like Number, String, etc.

3.  Use a custom prototype chain traversal to match class inheritance.
