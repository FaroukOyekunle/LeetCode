✅ Explanation

Problem:

-   Print only the 10th line of a file named file.txt. If the file contains fewer than 10 lines, print nothing.

-   sed is a stream editor that processes text line-by-line.

-   The -n flag suppresses automatic printing.

-   '10p' tells sed to print only the 10th line.

-   If file.txt has fewer than 10 lines, nothing is printed — which is the desired behavior.
