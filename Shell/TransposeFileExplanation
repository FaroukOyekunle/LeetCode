âœ…Explanation:
-   awk processes the file line by line.

-   NF is the number of fields (columns) in the current line.

-   NR is the current record (line) number.

-   a[i] stores the i-th column of all rows.

-   On the first line, we initialize a[i] with the first row values.

-   On subsequent lines, we concatenate values to a[i].

-   In the END block, we print each collected column (which becomes a row in the transposed output).
