âœ…  Explanation:

1. tr -s ' ' '\n' < words.txt

    -   It translates spaces into newlines and squeezes multiple spaces into one, effectively splitting words into lines.

2. sort

    -   Sorts words alphabetically to prepare for uniq.

3. uniq -c

    -   Counts the occurrences of each unique word.

4. sort -nr

    -   Sorts the lines numerically in reverse (descending frequency).

5. awk '{print $2, $1}'

    -   It rearranges the output to word count format.
