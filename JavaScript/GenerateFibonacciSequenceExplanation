✅ Explanation

1.  Initialize two variables:

    -   a = 0 (the current Fibonacci number)

    -   b = 1 (the next Fibonacci number)

2.  Infinite loop (while (true)) so the generator never “runs out.” Each call to next() will produce another Fibonacci number.

3.  yield a returns the current number (0, then 1, then 1, 2, 3, …).

4.  Update the pair:

    [a, b] = [b, a + b];

    -   After yielding, a becomes the old b,

    -   b becomes the sum of the old a + b.
