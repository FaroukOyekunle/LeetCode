âœ… Explanation:
-   createCounter(n) initializes a variable current with the value of n.

-   The returned inner function is a closure, which retains access to current even after createCounter has finished execution.

-   Every time you call the counter(), it:

    1.  Returns the current value.

    2.  Increments current by 1 for the next call.

This mimics the behavior of a persistent counter starting from n.
