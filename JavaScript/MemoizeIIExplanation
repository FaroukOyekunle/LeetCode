✅ Explanation

-   We use nested Maps so each set of arguments (by reference) leads to one cached result.

-   We store the actual result under a special key ('__result__') to avoid confusion with function arguments.

-   The function supports arbitrary number and types of arguments (as long as they’re not NaN).
