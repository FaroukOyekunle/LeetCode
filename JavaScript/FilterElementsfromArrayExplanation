âœ… Explanation:

-   I define a new function filter that mimics the behavior of Array.prototype.filter.

-   fn can take one or two arguments: the element arr[i] and its index i.

-   I initialize an empty array result.

-   I iterate through the input array:

    -   For each element, i call fn with the current element and index.

    -   If the result is truthy, i push the element into result.

-   Return the result array after the loop completes.
