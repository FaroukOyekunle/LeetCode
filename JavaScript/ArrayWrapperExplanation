✅ Explanation

*   In JavaScript, two key methods enable custom behavior for operators:

-  valueOf() — defines the primitive value of the object. This is used when using arithmetic operations like +.

-   toString() — defines the string representation of an object. This is used when calling String(obj) or ${obj} in a template literal.
