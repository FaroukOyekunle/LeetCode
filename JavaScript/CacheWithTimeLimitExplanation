âœ… Explanation:

-   set(key, value, duration)

    -   If key already exists, clear its old timer and mark existed = true.

    -   Set a new timeoutId that will delete the key after duration milliseconds.

    -   Store { value, timeoutId } in the Map.

-   get(key)

    -   Return the value if key exists, otherwise return -1.

-   count()

    -   Simply return the number of items in the Map (unexpired).

Important Concepts:
    -   clearTimeout is critical to cancel previous expiration when a key is reset.

    -   Map is used to store each key along with its timeout reference.
