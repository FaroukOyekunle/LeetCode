✅ Explanation:

-   Object.keys(obj) returns an array of the object’s own enumerable property names.

    -   For an object: it returns its keys.

    -   For an array: it returns its indexes as strings (["0", "1", ...]).

-   If the array length is 0, then:

    -   The object has no keys → it's an empty object.

    -   The array has no indices → it's an empty array.
