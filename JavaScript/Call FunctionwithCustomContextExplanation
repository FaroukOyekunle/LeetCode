âœ… Explanation

-   I temporarily assign the function to the context object using a unique Symbol to avoid key collisions.

-   Invoke the function as a method on the context using the spread arguments.

-   Delete the temporary key after the function is called to clean up.

-   Return the result of the function execution.

-   This mimics the internal workings of Function.prototype.call, without actually using it.
