âœ… Explanation:

-   I define groupBy on Array.prototype so it works on any array.

-   For each item in the array:

    -   I compute the key using the provided function fn.

    -   If the key doesn't exist in the result object, i initialize it with an empty array.

    -   I push the current item to the corresponding key in the result.

-   The final result is an object where:

    -   Each key is derived from fn(item).

    -   Each value is an array of items that generated that key.
