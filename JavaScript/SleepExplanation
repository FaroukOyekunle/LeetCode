Explanation:

-   setTimeout(resolve, millis) waits for the given number of milliseconds and then resolves the promise.

-   Wrapping it in async allows us to use await sleep(millis) if desired.

-   The function will pause execution for approximately millis milliseconds when awaited or chained with .then().
