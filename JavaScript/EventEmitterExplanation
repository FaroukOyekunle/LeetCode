✅ Explanation

-   this.events — A map where each key is an event name, and the value is an array of subscriber objects ({ eventName, callback }).

-   subscribe(eventName, callback)

    -   Adds a callback to the list of subscribers for eventName.

    -   Returns an object with an unsubscribe() method that removes the callback from the list.

-   emit(eventName, args)

    -   Invokes all callbacks associated with the given eventName in the order they were added.

    -   Returns an array of return values from the callbacks.

-   The unsubscribe logic uses reference equality and closure to remove the exact callback.
