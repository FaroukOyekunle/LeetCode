✅ Explanation

-   We’re given an array of functions, each returning a Promise. The goal is to:

1.  Execute all functions immediately in parallel (i.e., not sequentially).

2.  Return a new Promise that:

    -   resolves with an array of resolved values (in the same order) if all functions resolve.

    -   rejects as soon as any one of them rejects — with that error.
