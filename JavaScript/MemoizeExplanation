âœ… Explanation:

-   const cache = new Map();: to store arguments and results.

-   const key = JSON.stringify(args);: turn args into a unique string so they can be used as a key (e.g., [2, 3] and [3, 2] are different).

-   callCount++: we only increment if actual fn is called (not when serving from cache).

-   memoizedFn.getCallCount(): allows checking how many real function calls have been made.
