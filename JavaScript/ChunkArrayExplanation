âœ…Explanation

-   Split the input arr into subarrays (chunks) of size elements each.

-   I initialize an empty result array to store the chunks.

-   Then loop through arr in steps of size.

-   Use Array.prototype.slice() to extract a portion of the array from index i to i + size.

-   .slice() is safe here even if i + size exceeds array bounds.

- Then push each chunk into the result array.

-   Edge Cases:

-   If arr is empty, the loop is skipped, and an empty array is returned.

-   If size is greater than arr.length, one chunk containing the entire array is returned.
