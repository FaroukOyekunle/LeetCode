✅ Explanation:

1.  Map Storage:

    -   Use a Map to associate each object with its id for quick access and uniqueness.

2.  First Pass (arr1):

    -   Insert each object from arr1 into the map with a shallow copy.

3.  Second Pass (arr2):

    -   If the id already exists, merge the objects, giving preference to values from arr2.

    -   If not, insert the new object.

4.  Sorting:

    -   Convert the map values to an array and sort by id in ascending order.

⚠️ Note: This performs a shallow merge—nested objects like "b": {} will be replaced, not deeply merged. This aligns with the problem requirements (arr2 overrides).
