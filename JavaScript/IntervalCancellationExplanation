âœ… Explanation

-   fn(...args) is called immediately at time 0.

-   setInterval(fn, t) schedules repeated calls every t ms.

-   clearInterval(intervalId) in the returned cancelFn will stop the repeated execution when called.

-   We use setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs) outside this function to invoke cancelFn at the desired cancel time.
