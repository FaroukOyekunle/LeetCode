-   The goal is to schedule a function fn to run after t milliseconds.

-   If a cancellation function cancelFn is called before the timeout expires, the execution is prevented.

-   We use setTimeout to schedule the call of fn(...args) after t ms.

-   The returned cancelFn calls clearTimeout(timeoutId) to cancel the execution if it's still pending.
