âœ… Explanation:

-   timeoutId stores the ID of the pending setTimeout call.

-   Every time the returned function is invoked, it clears any existing timeout.

-   A new timeout is set to execute fn(...args) after t milliseconds.

-   If the function is called again within the debounce window (t ms), the previous call is canceled.
