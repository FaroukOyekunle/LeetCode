âœ… Explanation:

-   Promise.all([promise1, promise2]): Waits for both promises to resolve.

-   await: Ensures both values are retrieved before continuing.

-   return value1 + value2: Returns a new promise that resolves with the sum.

*   This handles both asynchronous resolution and summation cleanly.
